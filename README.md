# Music Genre Classification

## Overview

This project aims to classify music genres using machine learning and deep learning techniques. It includes implementations of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

## Data

The dataset used for this project is [provide dataset source and details].

## Requirements

- Python [version]
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scipy, os, pickle, librosa, IPython, scikit-learn, tensorflow, matplotlib, seaborn

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/talhacercioglu/music_genres.git
   
## Usage
Run the Jupyter notebook main.ipynb to see the step-by-step process of music genre classification using different algorithms.
Experiment with different parameters and models to improve performance.

## Results
Include visualizations, confusion matrices, and any other relevant results from your experiments.
